        <p>Quinielizer is a simple app that helps you to write "encoded" numbers.</p>
        <p>This can be helpful in some situations when you need to give a number to another person without other people notice it. Phone numbers, for example.</p>
        <p>What this does is just transform the number in it "Dream meaning" as gamblers do in Argentina. It's based on the info provided <a href="http://www.quini-6-resultados.com.ar/significado-suenos.aspx">here</a>.</p>

## How to use

Type the number you want to hide and choose an option (dreams, professions). The app will show your encoded number.

You can select and copy the code to paste whenever you want.

It's possible also to use Spotlight for quick searches (up to 2 digits):
